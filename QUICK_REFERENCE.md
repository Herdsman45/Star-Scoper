# Star Scoper OCR - Quick Reference

## Hotkeys

- **Alt+Shift+S**: Capture screen, process text, and generate Discord command
- **Ctrl+D** or **Command+D** (macOS): Toggle between dark and light theme

## Discord Command Format

```
/call world: X region: Y size: Z relative-time: W
```

Where:

- **X** = World number (e.g., 39)
- **Y** = Region (e.g., A or B)
- **Z** = Size (e.g., 5, 7, 9)
- **W** = Relative time (e.g., 40m, 1h 15m)

## Common Issues

1. **OCR not working properly**

   - Ensure your game resolution is set to at least 1080p
   - Make sure telescope text is clearly visible
   - Try adjusting your game's text contrast settings

2. **App not capturing**

   - Restart the application
   - Check if you have permission issues (especially on macOS)
   - Verify that the correct hotkey is being used for your OS
   - Ensure the app is on the same monitor as your game (for multi-monitor setups)

3. **Multi-monitor setup**

   - Application must be on the same monitor as the game window
   - Can run minimized while capturing screenshots
   - Check display scaling settings if using monitors with different resolutions

4. **Incorrect formatting**
   - Verify the telescope text is clearly visible in game
   - Manual edit may be required for some edge cases
