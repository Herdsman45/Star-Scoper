#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
; Discord Auto-Paste Integration Script for Star Scoper (AutoHotkey v2)
; This script watches for the Discord call file and automatically pastes it into Discord
;
; Instructions:
; 1. Enable "Text File Output for Automations" in the Star Scoper app settings
; 2. Run this script (it will run in the background)
; 3. Use Star Scoper as normal - when a call is processed, it will be auto-pasted into Discord
;
; Requirements:
; - Discord window must be named "Discord" (works with regular Discord client)
; - The script will focus Discord and paste the call automatically
;
; Press Ctrl+Alt+Q to exit this script
